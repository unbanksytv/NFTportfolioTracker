## Problems we are addressing

1. Traders cannot conduct NFT<>NFT trades despite many gaming/card NFTs
2. Portfolio value is quite naive by using floor price alone

## Project Solution

An NFT to NFT Trading marketplace through an escrow smart contract combined with a NFT Portfolio valuation with collection aggregate statistics

## Features

Main features for each page built

### Portfolio Page

1. view all NFTs owned
2. view net worth of NFTs, total NFT count, collection count
3. view macro statistics of NFT collections owned
4. sell and trade currently owned NFTs

### Explore Page

1. purchase NFTs listed by other users for ETH
2. trade NFTs listed by other users for user's NFTs

### Trade Pages

1. view pending NFT to NFT trade offers initiated by user and initiated to user
2. click on pending NFT to NFT trade offers to confirm/execute them
3. view executed NFT to NFT trades
4. selection screen to choose user's NFTs for another user's NFTs and begin a trade offer to the other user

### Home Page

1. ability to sign up for beta access for our platform

## Limitations of our solution

1. Cross chain NFT trading not yet implemented
2. Macro statistics might be expensive to query and analyze

## Future implementations

1. Add more filters on explore page
2. Add more search filters in trade selection screen
